Hello there!
This is my first and only(for now) python project that i'm actually proud of. This is suppose to be an android program using python android app library(?) but due to some circumstances (and a lot of nomral game losses), i wasn't able to continue. But atleast it works. Might update this soon when I finally get a job and sort my life out but everyone is welcome to use the script however they want.
Enjoy weebs and stay hydrated!
